        <p>Hello! I will be using this site to collect sources and document my understanding on the various coding topics required for my CIT 261 class. Here's the exact phrasing as found in my course's syllabus:</p>

          <blockquote><p>In order to produce effective applications for mobile devices and to accomplish the outcomes for the course (see the Syllabus), a strong knowledge, understanding, and ability is required in many areas. In order to achieve this it is suggested that each student needs to know, understand, and be able to use the following tools and concepts:</p>

          <ol>
          <li>The software development process and some standard methodologies,</li>
          <li>Creative, pleasant, mobile user interface creation</li>
          <li>JavaScript objects</li>
          <li>DOM manipulation</li>
          <li>CSS3 transitions</li>
          <li>CSS3 animations</li>
          <li>Using local data storage</li>
          <li>AJAX interactions with remote services</li>
          <li>JSON data serialization</li>
          </ol>

          <p>This list is not presented in any specific order and is not comprehensive of all that is needed to be successful in the mobile application industry, this course, nor the web application industry. The student will also need to identify other tools, topics, and/or abilities they may need, are interested in, and then know, understand, and use them effectively and well.</p>
          </blockquote>
